## DAO Export Class


</div>

### Description

This is the code from a class module for exporting from any Jet database to any ISAM format out there. I think it neatly encapsulates the process, and uses properties and methods to make the process as easy as possible.
 
### More Info
 
There are filter properties you can set, which will then return an appropriate filter string for the Common Dialog, and you can use either the properties or pass most of the parameters directly. It will ask for a password if you try to open a password-protected database as your source. From Access to text, excel, dbase, foxpro, html, or into another Access mdb, From excel to text, from text to html, etc. You can select individual fields from table to export if you open a database, and choose a new table name if you wish, You can insert multiple tables as worksheets into a single Excel Workbook, etc.

I have included the class module, along with a demo form to see how it works.
